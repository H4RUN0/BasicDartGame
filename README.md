Write a C# program to simulate a dart game on a square dart board. The program must read the number of darts to be thrown from the user, 
generate random target coordinates within the board(7 to 7 square which is centered to origin), determine the region of each dart hit, and display the statistics of dart hits for each region.

The dart board is a square, and has four regions (A, B, C, D).
Any hit outside these regions is a missing hit. Every dart hits the board at a random coordinate (x, y).
